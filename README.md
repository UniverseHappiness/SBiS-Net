# SBiS-Net

We provide the official PyTorch implementation of **SBiS-Net** in the scenario of **semi-supervised medical image segmentation**.  

> **Note:** This repository is currently under development. Some features, training scripts may not yet be available.  Currently, experiments and training are only supported on the **ACDC dataset**. Support for additional datasets may be added in future updates.
